            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li> 3/4 cup fine semolina </li>
            <li>  1/4 cup all purpose flour  </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp salt </li>
            <li> 1/2 water (more or less) </li>
            <li> olive oil </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <h3>Steps: </h3>
            <li> In a large bowl, mix semolina, flour and salt.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle water over the semolina mixture, little by little.</li>
            <li> Mix everything with your hand and stop adding water once the dough gets together. No need to knead the dough. </li>
            <li> Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest on the counter for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Divide the dough into 3 pieces. You can do this step before letting the dough rest.</li>
            <li> Dust your working board with flour and roll out each piece of dough into thin long strip or sheet, using a rolling pin (you may need to cut the long strip into half to make the work easy).</li>
            <li> Pass each pasta sheet (slightly dusted with flour) in the pasta machine to get a thin sheet. You should set up your machine to the thickness close to that of your pasta sheets, then end up with the lowest setting to get the thinest sheet.</li>
            <li> Place your thinnest sheets on a clean kitchen towel and let them dry for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Pass each pasta sheet in the part of the machine that makes thin noodles.</li>
            <li> Place a plate underneath to catch the noodles or the Rechta.</li>
            <li> Once you make about a plate of Rechta, start to steam it. Place the Rechta in the top of a steamer( the top of the steamer should be oiled with olive oil to avoid stickiness).</li>
            <li> Steam for about 5 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> Work on the other pasta sheets and make more Rechta.</li>
            <li> Steam the Rechta in small batches.</li>
            <li> Dump the steamed Rechta in a large shallow dish.</li>
            <li> Drizzle with about 1 tbsp olive oil and start separating the noodles with hands. You may not need to add olive oil for the second batch of Rechta.</li>
            <li> Once all the Rechta or noodles are separated, let cool then store in ziploc bags.</li>
            <li> Place the bags in the freezer for later use.</li>
